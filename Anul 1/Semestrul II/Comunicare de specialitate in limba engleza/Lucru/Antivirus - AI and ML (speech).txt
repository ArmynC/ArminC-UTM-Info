Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to programs and machines that execute tasks with the characteristics of human intelligence, including problem-solving, forward planning, and learning. Broadly speaking, machines that can do human tasks in a what, perhaps considered, "intelligent" way.

Machine Learning (ML) refers to a spectrum of AI technologies focusing on the idea that machines with data access and the correct programming can learn for themselves.

Machine learning in antivirus technologies isn't new. It is getting more intelligent, and is easier to use as a marketing tool now that the wider public is more aware of ML and AI.
