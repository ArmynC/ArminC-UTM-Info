I, the uploader, do not own the rights to all of the files provided here. Some files are my own and may have specific licenses associated with them, while others are from unattributed sources. The disclaimer for files from unattributed sources takes precedence over any specific licenses provided with my own files.

For the files that are my own and have specific licenses, please refer to the accompanying documentation or licensing information provided with those files for details on their permitted use.

For files from unattributed sources, they are provided as-is, without any license or permissions granted by me. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of these files complies with applicable copyright and intellectual property laws. These files are intended for learning purposes only. I strongly recommend obtaining proper authorization or permissions from the rightful owner(s) of these files before using them for any other purpose.

By accessing and using these files, you agree to do so at your own risk and responsibility. I do not accept any inquiries or requests regarding copyright, licensing, or permissions for these files. I explicitly decline all rights to these files.

It is strongly discouraged to use files from unattributed sources for any harmful, illegal, or piratical activities. Instead, I encourage users to support the authors by purchasing their work or making donations, where applicable, to help sustain their creativity and respect copyright laws.
